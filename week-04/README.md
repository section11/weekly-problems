Hey, you’re in luck. This week’s Weekly Problem asks you only to work on an aspect of your Project
One, which asks you to “Use at least three min-width media queries to enhance mobile-first styles
for larger screens”.

If you’re new to media queries and mobile-first responsive design, have a look at this article:
<https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-mobile-first-media-queries/>

And of course and as always, as you work, please post to Basecamp with your questions and problems.

Once you’ve completed the basic mobile-first responsive design for your Project One, you need to do
two things for this week’s Weekly Problem:

1. Place a copy of your stylesheet into the `week-04/` directory in your Weekly Problems repository.
2. In this README file below, explain in a paragraph or two how you went about executing your basic
   responsive design, and what additional remaining help or guidance you need (which you should
   also post to Basecamp).
